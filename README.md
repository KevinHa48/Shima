NJIT Hackathon 2022 Submission

This is a app designed for hikers to mark a breadcrumb trail. The user can mark the location of his/her campsite, and the app will automatically keep track of a path from the start point until when the user loses signal. The app will warn the user that he/she lost signal so the user doesn't get lost.

This application only works on IOS and android.
